### Feature and Bug Requests

Submit issues and feature requests in the [Issues](https://github.com/julcnx/strava-heatmap-extension/issues) section above.

## Extension Background

Previously, accessing Strava heatmap in OpenStreetMap iD editor required a tedious process of extracting Strava website cookies and generating a temporary URL that would expire after a week.

The [JOSM Strava Heatmap Extension](https://github.com/zekefarwell/josm-strava-heatmap) simplified this process, but due to the lack of support for custom overlays in the iD editor, users could only add the URL as a custom background.

With this extension, you can now automatically access all Strava activities as Heatmap overlays, eliminating the need for manual URL management.

To learn more about using the Strava Heatmap in OpenStreetMap, visit the [Strava wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Strava).

### Support for Other Sites

This extension currently supports the iD editor, [gpx.studio](https://gpx.studio), and [CalTopo](https://caltopo.com/). I'm not taking on additional sites at the moment. If you'd like to add support for another tool, feel free to fork the project.

- For JOSM, check out the [JOSM Strava Heatmap Extension](https://github.com/zekefarwell/josm-strava-heatmap).
- For RapidId, refer to the [RapId Power User Extension](https://github.com/emersonveenstra/rapid-power-user-extension/).
